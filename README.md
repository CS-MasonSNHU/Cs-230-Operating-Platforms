Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements:

The Gaming Room, the client, required a web-based version of their game application, "Draw It or Lose It," where teams compete to guess images drawn from a stock library. The game involves multiple rounds and requires support for multiple teams and players, with unique identifiers for each game, team, and player to ensure only one instance of the game is active at a time.

What I Did Well:

I excelled in thoroughly documenting the software requirements and design constraints, which helped create a clear foundation for the development process. This attention to detail ensured that the architecture was robust and met the client's needs.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document:

Working through the design document was particularly helpful in organizing the project’s requirements and constraints, allowing for a structured approach to coding. It also provided a clear roadmap for system architecture and design choices.

Potential Revisions:

If I were to revise one part of the documentation, I would focus on the domain model. I would improve it by refining the class relationships and ensuring that they are more explicitly tied to the game’s functional requirements. This would enhance the clarity and alignment of the design with the client’s needs.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs:

I carefully interpreted the user’s needs by prioritizing scalability, security, and performance in the design. It’s crucial to consider the user's needs in software design to ensure the final product aligns with their expectations and provides a seamless user experience.

Approach to Software Design:

I approached the design by breaking down the system into modular components, focusing on scalability and security. In the future, I would continue to use modular design and also implement more iterative testing phases to catch issues early. Techniques like prototyping and user feedback loops would be valuable for similar projects.
